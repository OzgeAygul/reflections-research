ScrollyVis: Interactive Visual Authoring of Guided  Dynamic Narratives for Scientific Scrollytelling
===
This paper explores the development and application of ScrollyVis, a tool designed to facilitate the creation of data driven and scientific narratives using scrollytelling.
I specifically chose this paper, as I am using scrollytelling library called **Idyll** for the final project.
This is a great technique where the content changes as users scroll through a webpage.

While it is a powerful tool to convey complex stories and information on the web, the authors identify a gap in existing tools for creating scrollytelling content, particularly for scientific and data-driven narratives that require specialized visualization techniques.
ScrollyVis is described as a web-based authoring tool that allows users to easily create and edit scrollytelling content without requiring advanced web development skills.
It integrates various media types including text, images, videos, and interactive visualizations such as maps and 3D models.
The tool supports the creation of dynamic narratives, allowing content creators to design stories that adapt and respond to user interactions.

Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the application of ScrollyVis in different scientific fields.
User studies, including feedback from 12 participants from various professional backgrounds, are used to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of the tool.
They measure the time it takes to create the story they are given and participants are evaluated based on their success. 
This paper effectively showcases the development and potential of ScrollyVis as a tool for enhancing the presentation of scientific information through engaging, dynamic narratives.
It contributes to the field by addressing the need for more accessible and interactive storytelling tools in scientific communication.
