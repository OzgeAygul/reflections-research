Supporting the Problem-Solving Loop: Designing Highly Interactive Optimisation Systems
===
This paper explores and evaluates interactive optimization literature and discusses nine design recommendations. 
They also provide reflections on existing interactive optimization in the literature based on recommendations they develop.
In short, their recommendations are to build trust between optimization algorithms, which are often seen as a black box, and non-expert users.
Therefore, it is essential to provide 1) Visual representations of solutions; 2) Support user modification for constraints, variables and/or objective functions; 3) Allow direct manipulation of solutions; 4) Provide a gallery of solutions for users to compare; 5) Allow users to re-optimize while changing minimal parts of the solution; 6) Support solution comparison; 7) Generate diverse solutions; 8) Provide feedback on the solving process, such as solving time; and 9) Record solution provenance to go back to a previous solution or step.
Based on these nine recommendations, they found that while some recommendations are supported by interactive optimization systems, such as visualization of solutions, many are not.
They also designed an interactive optimization tool for vehicle routing problems, and conducted a user study with 10 non-expert participants to evaluate the tool.
They conclude that participants found the tool highly usable and interactive, and there is strong support for most of the developed design recommendations.
