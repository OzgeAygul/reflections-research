Supporting the Problem-Solving Loop: Designing Higly Interactive Optimisation Systems
===
This paper explores and evaluates interactive optimization literature and discuss nine design recommendations. 
They also provide reflections on exiting interactive optimization in the literature based on recommendations they develop.
In short, their recommendations are to build trust between optimization algoritms, that are often seen as blackbox, and non-expert users.
Therefore, it is essential to provide 1) Visual representations of solutions; 2) Support user modification for constraints, variables and/or objective function; 3) Allow direct manipulation of solutions; 4) Provide a gallery of solutions for users to compare; 5) Allow users to re-optimize while changing minimal parts of the solution; 6) Support solution comparasion; 7) Generate diverse solutions; 8) Provide feedback on the solving process, such as solving time; and 9) Record solution provenence to go back to a previous solution or step.
Based on these nine recommendations, they found that while some recommendations are supported by interactive optimization systems, such as visualization of solutions, many are not.
They also design an interactive optimization tool for vehicle routing problem, and contuct a user study with 10 non-expert participants to evaluate the tool.
They conclude that participants found the tool higly usable and interactive, and there is strong support for most of the developed design recommendations.
